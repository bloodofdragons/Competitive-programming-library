BASE CASE --> Check some condition / increment or decrement something and return from there.

ENUMERATE THE MOVES --> In this step we enumerate through all the possible moves.

IS THIS MOVE POSSIBLE --> In this step we check whether the move we are going to make is possible or not. (by checking some condition or constraints)

WHAT IF THE MOVE IS POSSIBLE ??

1- Do the move.
2- Move to the next choices you have.
3- Remove the move. (Backtracking step i.e. return to the previous state)



Note:- We are doing the "Remove the move" step because if the move we made did not satisfy the conditions then we have to make the current state of the problem
       to the previous state from we came.
